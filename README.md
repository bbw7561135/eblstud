=======

Python packages to conduct studies of the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL).

To use the package within python, add the path of the repository to your python home variable,
e.g. by typing (or including in your .bashrc file):
> export PYTHONPATH=".:/path/to/repo:/some/other/path:"

To use EBL model files, you have to set the EBL_FILE_PATH environment variable, e.g., by typing 
> export EBL_FILE_PATH=/path/to/repro/ebl/ebl_model_files
